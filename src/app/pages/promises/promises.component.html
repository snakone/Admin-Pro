<p>
  Promises have replaced callback functions as the preferred programming style for handling asynchronous calls.
  A promise is a holder for a result (or an error) that will become available in the future (when the async call returns).

  Promises have been available in JavaScript through third-party libraries (for example, jQuery and q).
  ECMAScript 6 adds built-in support for promises to JavaScript.
